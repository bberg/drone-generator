## Market Gaps and Opportunities

### What No Competitor Does Well:
1. **Harmonic education** - None explain the music theory behind drones
2. **Real-time synthesis with chord control** - Most use samples
3. **Scale/mode selection** - No competitor offers modal drone options
4. **Just intonation vs equal temperament** - Only Drone Lab addresses this
5. **Export/recording** - Limited across all free tools
6. **Slow evolution over time** - Few offer true generative movement
7. **Solfeggio/specific frequency tuning** - Available but not well-executed
8. **Sound bath practitioner tools** - No dedicated professional features

### Our Current Strengths:
- Real-time Web Audio synthesis
- Multiple oscillator types (sine, triangle, sawtooth)
- Chord types (pure, fifth, octave, major, minor)
- LFO modulation for movement
- Reverb and filtering
- Clean, modern interface
- No account/subscription required

### Areas to Improve:
1. More scale/mode options beyond basic chords
2. Slow evolution/generative features
3. Export/recording capability
4. Nature sound layering option
5. More presets for specific use cases
6. Harmonic series/overtone education
7. Binaural beat option for meditation
8. Just intonation tuning option
